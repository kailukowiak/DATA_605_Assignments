# Exercies for the chapter readings of week 1.

$$
x + y − z = −1 \\
x − y − z = −1\\
z =2
$$


### Setting up the matrixies:

```{r}
M <- matrix(c(1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 1), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
v <- matrix(c(-1, -1, 2),ncol = 1)
M
v
```

### Using the solve function:

```{r}
sol <- solve(M,v)
sol
```

### Testing it.

```{r}
M %*% sol
```

```{r}
t(M) * M 

# That looks good
```

```{r}
solve(M) %*% v # This way is a bit more by hand since we actually multiply the invers matrix by v. 
```
